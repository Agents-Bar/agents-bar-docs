Agents
======

We are currently using agents provided by the open source project `AI Traineree<AIT>`_.
You can see their source code at the github page with the same name, i.e. `ai-traineree <AITGithub>`_. 

Why AI Traineree? Is has the most suitable API for the job. We will, however, start adding different agents.
Either by onboarding different open source packages or implementing recent popular advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning research.
