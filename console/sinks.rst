Data Sink
=========

A Data Sink allows users to pass data steps to more than one agent.
This is useful if you are conducting an experiment and you would like to train different agents with the same information.


Create Data Sink
----------------

A new Data Sink can be created through the `Data Sink <https://agents.bar/console/console/sinks/>`_ option in console.
By clicking "Create Data Sink" button it will redirect you to a form with a few options.
Each data sink should have a unique name and it's strongly recommended for them to have some meaningful description.
The last option is to select which agents should be combined.
You can only feed agents that you own and are active, so if you don't see any in the list please make sure that you active agents
in the Agents view.
