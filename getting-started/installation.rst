Installation
============

To connect your application to our agents you'll need to download a client.
We currently provide a Python client but feel free to let us know if you want a client in a different version.

Python client
-------------

The client is uploaded to Pypi repository so it's as easy as doing `pip install` or updating your dependencies.
When we're ready to relase we will provide here client's package name. For now, sorry.
