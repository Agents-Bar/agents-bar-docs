Quick start
===========

The easiest way to try our service is to use publicly available `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xm6yogaof107QPpth4S5ZFJtkoIZ8-Bc?usp=sharing>`_.

The demo shows how to set up a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent and use it to solve the `Cart Pole <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0>`_ environment.
It goes through downloading the client, authenticating with the service and displaying agent's progress.
