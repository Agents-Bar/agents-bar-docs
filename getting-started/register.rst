Registration
============

To register a new user, please click on the "Register" button in the top right corner of the `homepage <https://agents.bar>`_.
or go directly to the `registration panel <https://agents.bar/register>`_.
Note, however, that this will take you to the English version page.
To change the language please visit the homepage and  use the gear settings icon in the top right corner.

Once you're in the registration panel we will ask you to provide your name, email address and password.
We ask for name only so that we can greet you nicely, email is for us to make sure we can communicate with you,
and password is to make sure that only you can modify your assets.
Although we ask you to confirm the password, we are happy to assist if you :ref:`forget your password <getting-started/register:Forgotten password>`.

A successful registration will take you to the `console view <https://agents.bar/console>`_ and you should also receive
a welcome email from us.

Change password
---------------

Changing password is a self service. Once you log into the `console <https://agents.bar/console>`_ go to your
profile and click on the *Change password* option.
To make sure that it's you, we will ask you your old password.
Don't worry if you :ref:`forgot your password <getting-started/register:Forgotten password>`, we are happy to assist.

Forgotten password
------------------

Because we don't know what's your password, in case you forget it we won't be able to recall it for your.
We can, however, assist you in creating a new one.
To get to the password recovery page you can either click on the "Log in" button and then go to "forgot password",
or use the `recover password page <https://agents.bar/console/recover-password>`_ directly.
Once you enter your email, we will send you a link which you can use to get a new password, and with further instructions.
